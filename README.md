# Poacher

Poacher is a full spectrum application for migrating the menu data for any restaurant on GrubHub, Uber Eats or DoorDash to any [Bubble](https://bubble.io) application server. 

Poacher works in two parts by first scraping the menu data including all menu items and their assosciated images, sides, optionals, sizes etc. This data is then preprocessed and uploaded through a series of API calls to a Bubble application server. This allows a **full migration of menu data from any online food platform to the Bubble application server**. Poacher can be easily modified to scrape from any additional online food provider not previously stated. Poacher can also be modified to upload the scraped data to any other application server.

Poacher can process and upload a menu of 200 items in under 60 seconds. Performance will vary depending on the processing power of the system that the script is run on.
